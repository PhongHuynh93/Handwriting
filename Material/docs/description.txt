This app was born after my Master's thesis, where I researched handwriting
recognition algorithms. Having quite good background knowledge, I tried to
implement a handwriting input mode for Android.


Features:
- Simple and easy to use
- Supports all Enghish letters, numbers and many special characters
  * numbers, [0-9]  
  * small letters, [a-z]  
  * big letters, [A-Z]  
  * special characters:  .,:;!?()[]{}<>/\'"^-_+*=@$#%
- Source code available at: https://github.com/joonazzz/drawinput.git


About security:
- User should always be cautious when installing 3rd party text input methods,
  as they could be used for example recording all text inputs. This is why
  Android will warn you when you enable any 3rd party text input method
- To make user more comfortable, I want to highlight that this app does not
  require Internet permission, and cannot upload any data back to developers.

About tecnologies:
- Simple character preprocessing
  * duplicate point removal
  * resampling to 12 points / char
  * normalization of coordinates to [0,1]
- Simple features
  * 4 features
    * normalized x
    * normalized y
    * sin(dx/dy)
    * cos(dx/dy)
- Two recognition strategies: by custom logic and rbf svm
  * Custom logic
    * some characters are easy to recognize by logic
      * Numbers: 1
      * Small letters: i, l, t, x
      * Big letters: E, F, H, I, T, X
      * Special chars: .,:;!/\-_+='"#
    * looks for stroke count, vertical, horizontal and diagonal lines, line
      crossings (X, T-junctions), line alignments, line width, line curvature,
      special points, etc...
  * RBF SVM
    * trained with UNIPEN- database
    * 15 training samples / char
